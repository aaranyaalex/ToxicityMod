# ToxicityMod

I made this to explore some deep learning and LLM techniques in Tensorflow.

The project acts as a moderator by intercepting chat messages and detecting their toxicity in communities. It can track users and toxicity stats for further analysis.

I deployed the chatbot in a Streamlit for a demo!
